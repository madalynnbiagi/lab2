            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p> Hi, my name is Madalynn Biagi, I am 22 years old. I am a transfer student attending Lesley University in Cambridge, MA. I transferred in as a junior last year in 2024 and now it's currently 2025 and I am a senior majoring in the BA Arts program. I am also a student athlete. I have been playing basketball since I was in kindergarten. I grew up in a small town called Lincoln in California.</p>

            <caption> This is me and my parents. My moms name is Annie and my dads name is Jacob. </caption>
            <p> I was born on July 22, 2003. I am the second oldest of 5. My oldest sister was 3 when I was born. When I was two my family lived in a small one story, three bedroom house. We had a dog named Liza. She was the same age as me in human years. My sister and I shared a room and we had a funny bed that had a pull out bed under it, which was my bed. The other bedrooms were my parents and the office. My parents started their own business at home before my older sister was born in the year 2000. My parents business was a youth basketball league called Hotshots. It had a slow start because they did not have their own facility with basketball courts. So they would rent out school gyms to host the games. When I was three  my younger brother was born and my parents decided to move to a better arria for their business. We ended up moving to a town called Lincoln. We now lived in a two story, 5 bedroom house. It was much bigger than our last house. We still did not have a facility to call our own. But with my parents' hard work and dedication they were able to afford their own facility.</p> 
            <p>After that their business was doing good. Because of my parents' business I have been playing basketball ever since I was 3. My life consisted of school and basketball. Growing up, playing basketball had its ups and downs. I would miss birthday parties or fun activities because I either had homework, practice, or games. This was hard for my younger self because my friends stopped inviting me to things because they knew I could not go. Once I was in high school I started to love basketball again. In fact, It was the only thing making me pay attention in school and getting good grades. Without good grades I could not play so it was very important to me. In my senior year of high school my basketball team made it to the championship and we got to play at the Golden One Center, which is where the Sacramento Kings play. That was a really fun experience. Now I am in college still playing basketball and I believe if I was not playing basketball I would have only gone to a community college and stopped after that. But because of my love for basketball and the college coaches wanting me to play. I went to college for basketball. The next hard part was picking a major, because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life after basketball. So I decided to get my BA in Art because I am good at it and love it as well. So here I am in my senior year at Lesley University playing basketball and getting a degree in Art, wondering what I will do next.</p>

          <p>When I have a basketball game I tend to listen to music to help get me in the zone or to help hype me up and get ready to play! Here is one of the songs that could come up in my basketball playlist.</p>
